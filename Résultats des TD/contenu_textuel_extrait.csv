Abstract
"Currently, breast cancer appears to be the most widespread cancer in the world and the most common cause of cancer deaths. This specific type of cancer affects women in both developed and developing countries. Prevention and early diagnosis are very important factors for good prognosis. A characteristic feature of cancer cells is the ability of unlimited cell division, which makes them immortal. Telomeres, which are shortened with each cell division in normal cells, are rebuilt in cancer cells by the enzyme telomerase, which is expressed in more than 85% of cancers (up to 100% of adenocarcinomas, including breast cancer). Telomerase may have different functions that are related to telomeres or unrelated. It has been shown that high activity of the enzyme in cancer cells is associated with poor cell sensitivity to therapies. Therefore, telomerase has become a potential target for cancer therapies. The low efficacy of therapies has resulted in the search for new combined and more effective therapeutic methods, including the involvement of telomerase inhibitors and telomerase-targeted immunotherapy."

Figure 1
"Association between hTERT, key signaling pathways, and senescence (acc. [21,22,39], modified). The hTERT subunit of telomerase can be involved in various metabolic pathways (e.g., NFκB, Wnt/β-catenin, and adhesion as well as senescence) and affect the expression of various genes. Under the influence of stress, hTERT is translocated to mitochondria, where hTERT protects mitochondrial metabolism by lowering the level of ROS and binding to mtDNA."
